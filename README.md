Mathematical Research & Publications

This repository contains my personal research notes and exploratory work in mathematics, with a strong focus on probability theory, stochastic processes, quantitative finance, and functional analysis.

The aim is to provide rigorous LaTeX documents (definitions, theorems, proofs, corollaries) that develop and formalize mathematical concepts, while also exploring connections to real-world applications in finance and data-driven modeling.

Contents

ðŸ“„ Research Papers & Notes: Formal documents in LaTeX covering advanced topics (probability, stochastic calculus, convergence, etc.).

ðŸ”Ž Exploratory Work: Preliminary ideas, drafts, and open questions.

ðŸ§® Quantitative Applications: Links between pure mathematical theory and its use in modern quantitative finance and stochastic modeling.

Current Highlight

Convergence at Infinity: A unified framework that formalizes the notion of convergence through exhaustion functions, introduces weighted norms, and provides a quantitative classification of convergence rates.

Roadmap

âœ” Add further research documents (stochastic integration, martingales, measure-theoretic foundations).
âœ” Extend applied notes bridging mathematical finance and probability.
âœ” Open exploration notebooks for future collaboration.

Usage

All documents are written in LaTeX. To compile:

pdflatex filename.tex
