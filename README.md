# Mathematical Research & Publications

This repository contains my personal research notes and exploratory work in mathematics, with a strong focus on probability theory, stochastic processes, quantitative finance, and functional analysis.

The aim is to provide rigorous LaTeX documents that develop and formalize mathematical concepts, while also exploring connections to real-world applications.

##  About This Repository

This space is organized into three main categories:

* **Research Papers & Notes:** Formal documents in LaTeX covering advanced topics (probability, stochastic calculus, convergence, etc.).
* **Exploratory Work:** Preliminary ideas, drafts, and open questions that form the basis for future research.
* **Quantitative Applications:** Notebooks and notes bridging pure mathematical theory and its use in modern quantitative finance and stochastic modeling.

## üåü Current Highlight: A Unified Framework for Convergence

The main document currently under development is **"A Unified Framework for Convergence at Infinity"**.

This work formalizes the notion of convergence in general spaces through the concept of **exhaustion functions**. It introduces a family of **weighted norms** (`||f||_{‚àû,h,p}`) and an **asymptotic rate constant** (`C_p(f)`) to provide a robust, quantitative classification of convergence rates.

##  Roadmap

My current research goals for this repository include:

- [ ] **Stochastic Integration:** Develop formal notes on the construction of the It≈ç integral.
- [ ] **Martingale Theory:** Add a document covering the fundamental martingale convergence theorems.
- [ ] **Applied Probability:** Extend the notes connecting probability theory and mathematical finance.
- [ ] **Collaboration:** Open exploration notebooks (`.ipynb` or `.md`) to foster collaboration on open problems.

##  Getting Started

All formal documents are written in LaTeX. To compile any of the `.tex` files into a PDF, you will need a LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live, MiKTeX).

From your terminal, navigate to the document's directory and run:

```bash
pdflatex filename.tex
